# Synthetic Labourer Photos

Place a small set of synthetic/placeholder images here (jpg/png).

Seeders will randomly copy one image per labourer into `storage/app/public/labourers/` and
persist the resulting `photo_path` on the labourer record.

Notes:
- Do not add real peoples’ photos without explicit consent.
- Keep the pool small (e.g., 8–20 images) for fast seeding.
